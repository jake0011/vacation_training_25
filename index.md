## About the Training
The program is designed as a **1-month (4-week) intensive training** in **web development** and **electronics**. It was tailored for a first year computer engineering student's needs and scope of knowledge but can be useful to enthusiasts who want to gain both foundational knowledge and hands-on skills that can be applied to real projects.

Rather than focusing only on theory, the training will follow a **project-based learning approach**. This means:
- You will build and experiment as you learn.
- Every concept introduced will be followed by practical implementation.
- By the end of the training, you will have completed mini-projects that showcase the skills you have acquired.

## What to Expect
- **Structured daily lessons** covering essential topics in web development and electronics. Some would be self-study, others an actual tutoring session.
- **Guided projects** that reinforce classroom lessons.
- **Resources and updates** shared here to ensure smooth participation.

We encourage you to actively engage, ask questions, and explore beyond the materials provided. With commitment and practice, this month-long journey will equip you with valuable technical skills and confidence to pursue bigger projects in the future.

Welcome once again, and letâ€™s begin this exciting learning adventure together!

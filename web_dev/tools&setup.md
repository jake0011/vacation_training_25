# Setup

### Why this matters
A small upfront investment in tooling and environment setup saves you hours of frustration later. The goal here is a reproducible environment that lets you focus on learning HTML/CSS, not fighting your tools.

### Accounts you should create (one-time)
- GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) — for hosting code and collaborating.
- An email account you check frequently (for GitHub notifications, password resets).

### Recommended tools
- **Text editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Lightweight, extensible, and widely used in industry.
- **Browser(s):** Chrome/Edge or Firefox (both include excellent devtools).
- **Git:** Version control (we’ll cover Git in a dedicated page).
- **Optional but helpful:** Live Server extension (for instant preview of your web pages).

### Quick installation checklist.
- [ ] Install VS Code
- [ ] Install Git (verify with `git --version`)
- [ ] Create a GitHub account.
- [ ] Install Live Server extension in VS Code
